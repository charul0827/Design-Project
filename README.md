Design-Project
==============

This project focuses on how a cooperative multi-vehicle system could be used as an experimental platform for advanced vehicle control applications which are of both academic and industrial interest. An experimental platform gives the possibility to evaluate different control algorithms and maneuvers which may not be feasible on real cars due to cost and security aspects. The platform is expected to mimic the possible real-world applications.
